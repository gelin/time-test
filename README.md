A couple of obvious tests to check how Java works with 
[Russian Return to Winter Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Russia#2014_zone_boundary_changes).

Note the time between 01 a.m. and 02 a.m. is considered as in a new timezone offset.
So between 00:55 and 01:05 is one hour and 10 minutes.
